# ParkIN
This project is designed so as to be used by Parking Company specializing in making vehicle  parking available to customers using their smartphones from anywhere, anytime. It is an  online app through which customers can view available car parking slots, register, view  profile and book car parking. 
1.2 Purpose of the System & Scope 
The advancement in Information Technology and internet penetration has greatly enhanced  various business processes and communication between companies (services provider) and  their customers of which car parking industry is not left out. This E-parking system is  developed to provide the following services: 
• Enhance Business Processes: To be able to use internet technology to project the Parking  company to the global world instead of limiting their services to their local domain alone,  thus increase their return on investment (ROI). 
• Online Parking Reservation: A tools through which customers can reserve available  Parking spots to save time. 
• Customer’s registration: A registration portal to hold customer’s details, monitor their  transaction and used same to offer better and improve services to them. 
This project traverse a lot of areas ranging from business concept to computing field and  required to perform several researches to be able to achieve the project objectives. 
The area covers include: 
∙ Parking industry: this includes the study on how the parking business is being done,  process involved and opportunity that exist for improvement. 
∙ JAVA technology used for the development of the application. 
∙ General customer as well as company’s staff will be able to use the application  effectively.

∙ An Android application means that the system will be available for access 24/7  except when there is a temporary server issue which is expected to be minimal. 
1.3 Methodology used for Analysis, Design & Development 
∙ A Requirements phase, in which the requirements for the software are gathered and  analyzed. Iteration should eventually result in a requirements phase that produces a  complete and final specification of requirements. 
∙ A Design phase, in which a software solution to meet the requirements is designed.  This may be a new design, or an extension of an earlier design. 
∙ An Implementation and Test phase, when the software is coded, integrated and  tested. 
∙ A Review phase, in which the software is evaluated, the current requirements are  reviewed, and changes and additions to requirements proposed. 
1.4 Methodology used for Data Collection:  
We have use Iterative model and prototype model. In iterative model stages are same as  waterfall model but in this the processes have fewer restrictions and it is conducted in several  cycles. We used prototype model to prepare the final document. 
1.5 Studying the documentation  
1. Easiness in modification of data: The proposed system provides the service of  parking available online for any available car & bike effectively and efficiently, for  efficient results, storing the details of the users, cars, etc. in such a way that the  database can be modified. 
2. User friendly: The proposed system is user friendly because the retrieval and storing  of data is fast and data is maintained efficiently. Moreover the Graphical User  Interface is provided in the proposed application, which provides user to deal with the  system very easily.

3. Reports are easily generated: Reports can be easily generated in a proposed system.  Any type of report can be generated in a proposed system, which helps the admin to  check which person book which slot. 
4. Sharing the data is possible: Data can be shared in this system. This means that two or more persons can use the same data in existing system provided that they have  right to access that data. 
1.6 Feasibility Study 
The feasibility study is carried out to test whether the proposed system is worth being  implemented. Feasibility study is a test of system proposed regarding its work ability, its  impact on the organization ability to meet user needs and effective use of resources. It is  usually carried out by a small number of people who are familiar with the information system  techniques understand the part of the business or organization that will be involved or  effected by the project and are skilled in 22the system analysis and design process. 
The key consideration involve in the feasibility study are: 
1. Technical Feasibility: 
Technical feasibility is concerned with the availability of hardware and software required for  the development of the system, to see compatibility and maturity of the technology proposed  to be used and to see the availability of the required technical proposed to be used and to see  the availability of required technical man power to develop the system. 
After the study we came to conclusion that we proceed further with the tools and  development environment chosen by us. This was important in our case as we were working  on 2 phases of department that will need to be integrated in future to make an extended  system. 
2. Operational Feasibility: 
Operational Feasibility is all about problems that may arise during operations. There are two aspects related with thus issue:
3 
∙ What is the probability that the solution developed may not be put to use or may not  work? 
∙ What is the inclination of the management and end users towards the solution?  Though, there is very least possibility of management being averse to the solution,  there is a significant possibility that the end users may not be interested in using the  solution due to lack of training, insight, etc. 
3. Economic Feasibility: 
It is the measure of cost effectiveness of the project. The economic feasibility is nothing but  judging whether the possibility benefit of solving the problems is worthwhile or not. At the  feasibility study level, it is impossible to estimate the cost because member’s requirement and  alternative solution have not been identified at this stage. However when the specific  requirements and solutions have been identified, the analyst weighs the cost and benefits of  all the solutions, this is called “cost benefit analysis”.
